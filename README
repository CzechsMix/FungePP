FungePP is a C++ interpreter for the Funge++ language (a procedural extenstion of Befunge-93)

===

Changes from the Befunge-93 spec:

a 4096x4096 grid is used instead of 25x80
a max stack size of 1024 is used

The 'H' (or gate) instruction is added. Execution is as follows
  -pop y, x, and d. move the PC to x,y with direction d%4 where 0=N,1=E,2=S,3=W
	-essentially, a goto

The '{' and '}' stack bank switches, moves to the previous and next bank respectively,
  -per the Funge++ spec, 1024 banks are available to you, each with it's own stack

The '[' and ']' stack carry switches, pops the top of the stack, moves to the previous and next bank respectively, and pushes the value onto that stack

The ';' (or empty) instruction is added. If the current stack bank is empty, push 0, otherwise push 1

Tabs vs Spaces

use 2 spaces for instead of tabs.
