FungePP is a C++ interpreter for the Funge++ language (a functional extenstion of Befunge-93)

Version: v0.1

===

Changes from the Befunge-93 spec:

a 4096x4096 grid is used instead of 25x80
a max stack size of 1024 is used

The 'H' (or gate) instruction is added. Execution is as follows
  -pop y, x, and d. move the PC to x,y with direction d%4 where 0=N,1=E,2=S,3=W
	-essentially, a goto

The '{' and '}' stack bank switches, moves to the previous and next bank respectively, the banks wrap
  -per the Funge++ spec, 1024 banks are available to you, each with it's own stack

The '[' and ']' stack carry switches, pops the top of the stack, moves to the previous and next bank respectively, and pushes the value onto that stack

The Portal commands, orange 'O' and blue 'B' O moves to previous bank, pushes direction, x and y, moves to the next bank, and gates. B moves to the previous bank, gates, moves to the next bank

The ';' (or empty) instruction is added. If the current stack bank is empty, push 0, otherwise push 1

Tabs vs Spaces
