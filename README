FungePP is a C++ interpreter for the Funge++ language (a procedural extenstion of Befunge-93)

===

Changes from the Befunge-93 spec:

a 4096x4096 grid is used instead of 25x80
a max stack size of 1024 is used

The 'H' (or gate) instruction is added. Execution is as follows
  -pop y, x, and d. move the PC to x,y with direction d%4 where 0=N,1=E,2=S,3=W
	-essentially, a goto

===

Tabs vs Spaces

use 2 spaces for instead of tabs.
